some basic UI next

create form to add.

display.js create DOM elements






----------------------------------
Register Category.js creation

first load Register loops over the tempStorage and creates the category Register.
Register.create()
every category like project week ,day only has an array of ids.
Stored in a register.js 
use it like Register.getWeek Register.getDay Register.getProjects...

when adding new task can use the same function as Register.create . 
deleting changing needs a different functionality.

when the category is first clicked(maybe on first load it doesn't matte for now)
 it calls the create dom module and create the list from the IdArray in Register.
